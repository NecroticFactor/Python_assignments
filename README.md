# CS50P Assignments Repository

This repository contains the assignments completed as part of **CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python**, a course by Harvard University. Each assignment explores different programming concepts and Python fundamentals, progressively building skills from basic to more advanced topics.
This repository also has codes that I wrote from my own ideas to reinforce these concepts and they are prefixed with "Idea"
